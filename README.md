🧭 Usage

vinitshahdeo [options]

Options
	•	--open=site|linkedin|github|twitter – open a destination directly and exit
	•	--no-anim – skip the animated banner (handy on slow terminals/SSH)
	•	-h, --help – show help

Examples

vinitshahdeo --open=github
vinitshahdeo --no-anim

Using npx? Replace vinitshahdeo with npx vinitshahdeo-cli.

🧪 Non-interactive / CI mode

When there’s no interactive TTY (e.g., CI pipelines or piped output), the CLI:
	•	Prints Quick Links to the console
	•	Exits with code 0

⸻

🎨 Colors

Respects common color environment variables:
	•	NO_COLOR – disable colors
	•	FORCE_COLOR=1 – force colors on

⸻

🐞 Troubleshooting
	•	“Couldn’t open automatically”
Don’t worry—we print the URL so you can copy/paste it.
	•	Weird card wrapping
Narrow terminals may wrap the profile card. Resize the window or zoom out, or just use --no-anim for a simpler experience.
	•	Signals (Ctrl+C, CI timeouts)
The CLI exits cleanly and returns 0 for graceful stops.
